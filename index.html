                Swami Vivekananda was a renowned Indian monk and philosopher who played a key role in introducing Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He was born on January 12, 1863, and his teachings continue to inspire people around the globe.

            <p>
                Vivekananda's famous speech at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 marked his significant impact on the global stage. He emphasized the importance of religious tolerance and the unity of all religions.

            <p>A spiritual genius of commanding intellect and power, Vivekananda crammed immense labor and achievement into his short life, 1863-1902. Born in the Datta family of Calcutta, the youthful Vivekananda embraced the agnostic philosophies
                of the Western mind along with the worship of science. At the same time, vehement in his desire to know the truth about God, he questioned people of holy reputation, asking them if they had seen God. He found such a person
                in Sri Ramakrishna, who became his master, allayed his doubts, gave him God vision, and transformed him into sage and prophet with authority to teach.</p>
            <p>After Sri Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda renounced the world and criss-crossed
                India as a wandering monk. His mounting compassion for India's people drove him to seek their material help from the West. Accepting an opportunity to represent Hinduism at Chicago's Parliament of Religions in 1893, Vivekananda
                won instant celebrity in America and a ready forum for his spiritual teaching. For three years he spread the Vedanta philosophy and religion in America and England and then returned to India to found the Ramakrishna Math
                and Mission. Exhorting his nation to spiritual greatness, he wakened India to a new national consciousness. He died July 4, 1902, after a second, much shorter sojourn in the West. His lectures and writings have been gathered
                into nine volumes.</p>
